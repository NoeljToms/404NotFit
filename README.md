## Usage:

Make sure before you run the notebook to add the files `kaggle (1).json` and `barbell biceps curl_0 (1).mp4` to your working directory to be able to download the kaggle dataset and to run the example with the video. If the `.json` does not work you may need to create a kaggle account, go to settings and create a new api token.
